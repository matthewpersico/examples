14:19:35 my $obj = new Frobinator arg1,arg2

vs

my $obj = Frobinator->new(arg1,arg2)

Can't recall the name for the former and exact reason it is discouraged.
14:19:43 Can someone job my memory?

14:22:38 There is a specific declaration of "new" that would cause this to invoke the wrong thing
14:22:56 I.e.: it could be parsed as a plain subroutine call, rather than a method call
14:23:07 I don't remember how to trigger it
